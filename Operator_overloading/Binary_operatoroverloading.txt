Overloading a binary operartion can be done in two diif ways 
  1. Overloading a binary operator using a non-member function
  2. Overloading a binary operator using a member functio

In  case 1. two parameters are passed into the definition of overloading 
In case 2. only one member is passed as a parameter ..
Reason is -> in the first case since overloading is done using a non membre function hence all the 
parametrs nbeeded to be passed explicitly
whereas in the operator overloading using the member function the left hand operator becomes the obj that 
calls the member method with the right one as an argument
